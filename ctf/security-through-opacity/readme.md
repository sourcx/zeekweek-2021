## Security Through Opacity

Zeek has some interesting datatypes which are refered to as opaque types. They include topk, hyperloglog, and bloomfilter structures. This challenge is about bloomfilters.

1. I ran zeek flags-to-bloom.zeek which started a broker listener and waited to receive events name add_flag on topic /topic/test..
2. I ran make_flags.py which generated all possible strings consisting of lowercase values with length 4, randomly selected one, and sent it to the zeek process. The zeek process handled the add_flag event and added the string to a bloomfilter.
3. The flags-to-bloom script printed 2 lines of output. One line was the string "flag added" the other is the serialized version of the bloomfilter containing only 1 string, the flag. Output was piped to a file named bloom.

See if you can recover the original value of the flag which was added to the bloomfilter.
